## Install

## Information
Browser Command is a multiplayer real time strategy game where you can manage resources, units, buildings, etc. The game is browser based, obviously based off the name, and has the potential for multiplatform support. We plan on implementing a community hub where you can access matchmaking, Mod/Script support, and leaderboards/stats. This game was inspired by a love of RTS games and creating Mods for games as well.

## Set up

1. Clone repo on your local machine
2. Run the command ```npm install --workspaces``` in the browser-command folder
3. Run the command ```npm start``` and wait for the command to finish running
This is what you should see when the command finishes running: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54562440/144363834-abe636b7-c02a-4aa1-a873-ab6b98327498.png)
4. Open localhost:3000 and the game should appear there
